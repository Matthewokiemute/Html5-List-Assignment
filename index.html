  <h3>Preperation:</h3>
  <!-- An ordered list on how it is prepared -->
  <ol>
    <li>Boil your meats first, if you’re using any. I’m using smoked turkey. Remember to start with the tougher meats,
      then add the softer ones as you go.</li>
    <li>When it’s tender, add the dried stockfish and the blended Scotch bonnet, continue to boil till the stockfish
      is tender and the meats/smoked turkey soft…</li>
    <li>Then, add the smoked fish, switch off the heat and simmer with the residual heat for 2-3 minutes…</li>
    <li>Now, transfer your palm nut extract into a big pot. If you’re using the tinned extract, it comes really thick, 
      dilute with hot water, the water should be almost double the quantity of the extract. I’ll be using the stock from 
      the meats as well, so, I’m including the quantity of the stock as part of the water I’m diluting the extract with.</li>
    <li>When you’ve added the water and stock, place on a hob on medium heat, mix thoroughly to break up clumps.</li>
    <li>Do not cover the pot from now till the end of the cooking process,
      Let this boil for 10-12 minutes…</li>
    <li>Then add the Banga Spice, Oburunbebe stick, ground crayfish or prawns, dried pepper, knorr cube and salt to taste.
      You may not need too much salt if your stock is well seasoned so be mindful.</li>
    <li>Now, add the Catfish or your preferred fresh fish and fresh shrimps, (now is a good time to add periwinkles 
      if you’re using any), turn the heat down to low, leave to cook for 7-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Blend your bitter leaves or Obeletientien…</li>
    <li>add the dried Obeletientien or bitter leaves, stir and combine…cook for 2 minutes, then switch off the heat.</li>
    <li>Leave to cook for a further 2-3 minutes with the residual heat</li>
    <li>Remove the Oburunbebe stick from the Soup</li>
    <li>And you’re done…</li>
  </ol>
  <!-- End of the preparation -->
